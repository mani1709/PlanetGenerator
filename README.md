# Procedural Planet Generator

This repo contains a procedural planet generator made in Godot. The editor + game can be run using a modified verision of Godot on Windows (I used a version of 4.3 with precision=double). [The documentation of Godot shows how this can be done](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/large_world_coordinates.html#enabling-large-world-coordinates).

The .exe file can be downloaded using the following link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/46l4xk8f0on4t7bvtcdyz/PlanetGenerator.exe?rlkey=fboafqed9o9o5o5muy1bah7rp&st=oevasd2l&dl=0
