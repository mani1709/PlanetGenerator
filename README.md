# Procedural Planet Generator

This repo contains a procedural planet generator made in Godot. The game can be run using the exe or it can be edited and run using a modified verision of Godot on Windows (I used a version of 4.3 with precision=double). [The documentation of Godot shows how this can be done](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/physics/large_world_coordinates.html#enabling-large-world-coordinates).
